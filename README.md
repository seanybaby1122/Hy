Here’s a comprehensive README-style documentation draft for your CLI commands plus some notes and ideas for unit tests, security considerations, extensibility, and advanced commands, aligned with your prompt and the CLI code you shared:

⸻

Absolute Knowledge Prediction System CLI

Overview

This CLI allows users to interact with the Absolute Knowledge Prediction System via commands for processing symbolic data, generating names, managing primitives and operations, and accessing documentation.

⸻

Getting Started

Run the CLI by creating an instance of CLI with a system instance and call:

cli = CLI(system)
cli.run()

Type help inside the CLI for a list of commands.

Exit with quit or exit.

⸻

Commands and Usage

process <symbolic_input>

Processes a symbolic input expression through the prediction system.
	•	Input: A Python expression representing symbolic input (e.g., a dictionary).
	•	Example:

process {'concept': 'gravity', 'magnitude': 9.8}


	•	Note: Input is evaluated with eval(), so be careful with input source.

⸻

name <type> <version> <identifier>

Generates a unique name for an element based on type, version, and identifier.
	•	Input:
	•	type: Element type string (e.g., “input”, “model”)
	•	version: Version string (e.g., “1.0”)
	•	identifier: A Python expression (string, int, dict, etc.)
	•	Example:

name input 1.0 {'user': 'alice'}


	•	Output: Generated unique name string.

⸻

docs <element_name>

Fetches documentation or description for a given element name.
	•	Input: Name of the documented element.
	•	Example:

docs input_1.0_123456789


	•	Output: Documentation text or message if none found.

⸻

add_primitive <name> <function_code>

Adds a new primitive function to the system.
	•	Input:
	•	name: Name of the primitive function.
	•	function_code: A Python lambda expression as a string.
	•	Example:

add_primitive multiply_by_two 'lambda x: x * 2'


	•	Warning: Uses eval() to parse code; unsafe for untrusted inputs.
	•	Recommendation: Use a restricted expression syntax or sandboxing for production.

⸻

compose_operation <operation_name> <primitive_names_comma_separated>

Defines a composed operation from a sequence of primitive functions.
	•	Input:
	•	operation_name: Name for the composed operation.
	•	primitive_names_comma_separated: List of existing primitive names separated by commas.
	•	Example:

compose_operation double_then_process multiply_by_two,process_data


	•	Output: Confirmation message or errors for missing primitives.

⸻

execute_operation <operation_name> <initial_data>

Executes a previously composed operation starting from initial_data.
	•	Input:
	•	operation_name: Name of the composed operation.
	•	initial_data: Python expression representing the initial data input.
	•	Example:

execute_operation double_then_process 10


	•	Output: Result of operation execution.

⸻

help

Displays all available commands and usage information.

⸻

quit or exit

Exits the CLI.

⸻

Example Session

> add_primitive multiply_by_two 'lambda x: x * 2'
Primitive 'multiply_by_two' added successfully.

> compose_operation double_then_process multiply_by_two,process_data
Operation 'double_then_process' composed with primitives: ['multiply_by_two', 'process_data']

> execute_operation double_then_process 5
Execution of operation 'double_then_process' result: ...


⸻

Unit Testing Suggestions
	•	Test all commands with valid and invalid inputs.
	•	Test error handling on missing arguments.
	•	Test add_primitive with valid/invalid function code.
	•	Test compose_operation with existing and missing primitives.
	•	Test execute_operation with valid operation names and invalid ones.
	•	Test process command input parsing.
	•	Mock the underlying system to isolate CLI logic.

⸻

Security Considerations
	•	eval() usage is unsafe on untrusted input.
	•	For production, consider:
	•	Using a safe expression parser (e.g., asteval, numexpr) or a custom mini-language for primitives.
	•	Restrict primitives to single expressions without side effects.
	•	Validate inputs thoroughly before execution.
	•	Run code with restricted permissions or sandboxing.

⸻

Extensibility Ideas
	•	Define standard JSON/YAML formats for symbolic data inputs and prediction outputs.
	•	Add commands like:
	•	dump_ontology — Export entire symbolic ontology for offline analysis.
	•	batch_process <file_path> — Process multiple inputs from a file.
	•	interactive_shell — Enter an advanced interactive mode with history and autocompletion.
	•	list_primitives — List all registered primitives.
	•	list_operations — List all composed operations.

If you want, I can help you create unit test examples or safer alternatives for primitive code parsing. Would you like that?
